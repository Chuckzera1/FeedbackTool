# Feedback Tool
 It's a tool to recieve some feedbacks. <br>
 The user can take a screenshot and insert some comments about the problem/idea their are having at the moment. <br>
 When he send's the feedback, we save in a database and also send a e-mail with the image and the comment. <br>
 There is an app too, but it's not in any store<br>
